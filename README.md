Project Overview

The Maromba Meals Logs App is a single-page application (SPA) designed to help users organize and store their healthy meal ideas.
With a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, the app makes it easy to build a personalized library of meals with nutritional information.
