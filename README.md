Project Overview

The Healthy Meals App is a full-stack, single-page application (SPA) designed to help users organize and track their healthy meal ideas.
With an intuitive interface and complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, the app makes it easy to build a personalized library of meals — complete with nutritional information.

Core Features

Meal Gallery
Upon launching the app, users are welcomed with a visually engaging gallery showcasing all meals logs.
Each meal appears as an interactive card, making browsing effortless and enjoyable.

Meal Details
Clicking the "Description" button on a meal card leads to a dedicated page containing in-depth information about the selected meal, including:
Ingredients: A complete list of all ingredients used.
Macros: A breakdown of macronutrients — including protein, carbs, fats, and total calories.

CRUD Functionality
Manage your meals with ease using the app's full CRUD support:
Create: Add a new meal via the "Add a Meal" button in the navigation bar.
Read: Browse all meals from the main gallery or view individual details on each meal’s page.
Update: Edit a meal’s ingredients, macros, or title directly from its detail page.
Delete: Remove meals permanently via the description page.

Navigation & Search
A persistent top navigation bar helps streamline user interaction:
Add a Meal: Instantly access the form to create new entries.
Search: Quickly locate specific meals using the built-in search bar.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React, HTML & CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express

Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL (choose depending on your actual stack)

Styling: Tailwind CSS / Material-UI
